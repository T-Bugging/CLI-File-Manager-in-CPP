CLI File Manager in C++

A lightweight Command Line Interface (CLI) File Manager implemented in C++ using basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. This project simulates basic file management operations similar to a Unix/Linux shell.

🚀 Features

help  — Displays a list of available commands

mkdir — Create a new directory

rmdir — Remove an existing directory

ls    — List contents of the current directory

cd    — Change the current directory

pwd   — Print the current working directory

touch — Create a new file

rm    — Delete a file

exit  — Exit the file manager

🧠 Implementation Details

Language & Tools: C++ compiled with MinGW (g++ version 6.3.0)

Headers Used:

<iostream> and <string> for basic input/output

<dirent.h> to list and navigate directories

<direct.h> for Windows-based directory creation and navigation

Directory and file names: Accepted using cin >> (only supports single-word names)

Core Logic: Command pattern implemented via string comparisons and if-else blocks.

Error Handling: Each command checks for validity (e.g., if a file/directory exists before creation/deletion).

🔍 How to Compile and Run

Compile

g++ -o filemanager filemanager.cpp

Run

./filemanager

⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

Does not support editing file contents.

Does not support file or folder names with spaces (use underscore _ or camelCase instead).

Requires MinGW or a Windows-compatible compiler as it uses <direct.h>.

No persistent metadata; it only uses the actual file system.

🛠️ Development Challenges

Couldn't use <filesystem> due to g++ 6.3.0 lacking support.

Needed to handle C-style strings (char*) due to direct.h/dirent.h functions.

Addressed output bugs like duplicated prompt messages.

Decided to use actual directories instead of simulating them via arrays to keep the project realistic and professional.

📂 Project Structure

All files and folders are created and managed in the current working directory of the executable. Changing directory (cd) updates the base path for all other commands like ls, touch, rm, etc.
